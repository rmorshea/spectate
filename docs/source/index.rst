Spectate
========

A library for Python 2 and 3 that can track changes to mutable data types.

With :mod:`spectate` complicated protocols for managing updates, don't need
to be the outward responsibility of a user, and can instead be done automagically
in the background. For instance, syncing the state between a server and client
can controlled by :mod:`spectate` so user's don't have to.
