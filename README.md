# Spectate

A library for Python 2 and 3 that can track changes to mutable data types.

With `spectate` complicated protocols for managing updates, don't need to be the outward responsibility of a user, and can instead be done automagically in the background. For instance, syncing the state between a server and client can controlled by `spectate` so user's don't have to.

# At A Glance

If you're using Python 3.6 and above, create a model object

```python
from spectate import mvc

l = mvc.List()
```

Register a view function to it that observes changes

```python
@mvc.view(l)
def printer(l, events):
    for e in events:
        print(e)
```

Then modify your object and watch the view function react

```python
l.append(0)
l[0] = 1
l.extend([2, 3])
```

```
{'index': 0, 'old': Undefined, 'new': 0}
{'index': 0, 'old': 0, 'new': 1}
{'index': 1, 'old': Undefined, 'new': 2}
{'index': 2, 'old': Undefined, 'new': 3}
```
