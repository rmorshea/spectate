    """Temporarilly withold change events in a modifiable list.

    All changes that are captured within a "hold" context are forwarded to a list
    which is yielded to the user before being sent to views of the given ``model``.
    If desired, the user may modify the list of events before the context is left in
    order to change the events that are ultimately sent to the model's views.

    Parameters:
        model:
            The model object whose change events will be temporarilly witheld.
        reducer:
            A function for modifying the events list at the end of the context.
            Its signature is ``(model, events) -> new_events`` where ``model`` is the
            given model, ``events`` is the complete list of events produced in the
            context, and the returned ``new_events`` is a list of events that will
            actuall be distributed to views.

    Notes:
        All changes witheld from views will be sent as a single notification. For
        example if you view a :class:`specate.mvc.models.List` and its ``append()``
        method is called three times within a :func:`hold` context,


    Examples:
        Note how the event from ``l.append(1)`` is omitted from the printed statements.

        undo:
            An optional function for reversing any changes that may have taken place.
            Its signature is ``(model, events, error)`` where ``model`` is the given
