class Control:
    """An object used to define control methods on a :class:`Model`

    A "control" method on a :class:`Model` is one which reacts to another method being
    called. For example there is a control method on the
    :class:`~spectate.mvc.models.List`
    which responds when :meth:`~spectate.mvc.models.List.append` is called.

    A control method is a slightly modified :ref:`beforeback <Control Beforebacks>` or
    :ref:`afterback <Control Afterbacks>` that accepts an extra ``notify`` argument.
    These are added to a control object by calling :meth:`Control.before` or
    :meth:`Control.after` respectively. The ``notify`` arugment is a function which
    allows a control method to send messages to :func:`views <view>` that are registered
    to a :class:`Model`.

    Parameters:
        methods:
            The names of the methods on the model which this control will react to
            When they are calthrough the Nodeled. This is either a comma seperated
            string, or a list of strings.
        before:
            A control method that reacts before any of the given ``methods`` are
            called. If given as a callable, then that function will be used as the
            callback. If given as a string, then the control will look up a method
            with that name when reacting (useful when subclassing).
        after:
            A control method that reacts after any of the given ``methods`` are
            alled. If given as a callable, then that function will be used as the
            callback. If given as a string, then the control will look up a method
            with that name when reacting (useful when subclassing).

    Examples:
        Control methods are registered to a :class:`Control` with a ``str`` or function.
        A string may refer to the name of a method on a `Model` while a function should
        be decorated under the same name as the :class:`Control` object to preserve the
        namespace.
